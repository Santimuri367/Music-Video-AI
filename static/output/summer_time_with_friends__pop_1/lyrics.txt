"Endless Summer Days"

Verse 1:
Cruising down the coast, windows rolled down
Sun-kissed skin, not a single frown
Laughter fills the air, stories we share
Making memories without a care

Chorus:
Oh, these endless summer days
Spending time in so many ways
With the friends who know me best
Feeling free and forever blessed
We'll chase the sun till it's gone
Singing our favorite summer song
These moments we'll never forget
'Cause summer's not over yet

(Repeat Chorus)
