Title: "Memories Under the Stars"

Verse 1:
We're living life like there's no tomorrow
Laughter filling up the air
Sipping drinks, telling stories
Without a single care

Chorus:
Oh, these nights with friends
Making memories that never end
Dancing 'till the break of dawn
These are the times we'll look back on
Oh, these nights with friends
Moments that we'll always defend
Together, everything feels right
Under the starry skies so bright

Verse 2:
Singing songs around the fire
Feeling the warmth inside
Friendship growing ever stronger 
As the hours pass us by

(Repeat Chorus)
