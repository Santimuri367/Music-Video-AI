"Summer Days with You"

Verse 1:
Sun's out, and the sky's so blue
Got my shades on, feeling brand new
Cruising down the street, windows rolled down
Music's blasting, we're painting the town

Chorus:
These summer days, they're ours to own
Making memories, we're never alone
Laughing, dancing, living carefree
Summer days with you and me
Oh, these summer days with you and me

Chorus:
These summer days, they're ours to own
Making memories, we're never alone
Laughing, dancing, living carefree
Summer days with you and me
Oh, these summer days with you and me
