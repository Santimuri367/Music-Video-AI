Title: "Solitude in the Stars"

Verse 1:
Floating through the cosmos, a soul adrift
Embraced by the endless expanse, a celestial gift
Constellations whisper secrets in the night
As I navigate this journey, far from Earthly light

Chorus:
Alone on space, I find my peace
Amidst the stars, my worries cease
In this vast and silent place
I discover beauty, and inner grace
Alone on space, where I belong
A symphony of solitude, an interstellar song
