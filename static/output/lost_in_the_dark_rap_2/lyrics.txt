Title: "Shadows of the Night"

Verse 1:
I'm wandering through the shadows, can't find my way
The darkness surrounds me, it's leading me astray
Every step I take, feels like I'm going nowhere
Lost in this labyrinth, breathing in the cold air
Trying to find a light, a glimmer of hope
But I'm sinking deeper, like I'm hanging from a rope
The night is closing in, and I'm losing my grip
Gotta find my way out, before I take this final trip

Chorus:
Lost in the dark, can't find my way home
Trapped in the night, feeling so alone
Shadows all around me, nowhere to go
I'm lost in the dark, put on quite a show
Gotta break free, from this endless night
Find the strength within, to win this fight
Lost in the dark, but I won't give in
I'll keep pushing forward, until I see the light again

Verse 2:
The darkness plays tricks, on my weary mind
Whispers in my ear, says I'll never rewind
Back to the light, back to the way things were
But I won't surrender, not to this nocturnal blur
I've faced my demons, fought through the pain
I'll find my direction, like a compass in the rain
Step by step, I'll navigate this shade
Until the sun rises, and the darkness starts to fade

(Repeat Chorus)
