Here is an original song with lyrics about beautiful Colombian women, written in a pop style:

"Colombian Queen"

Verse 1:
From the land of emerald green 
Where passion flows, and beauty gleams
A place where hearts beat wild and free
Colombia birthed a queen in me

Chorus: 
I am a Colombian queen
Radiant, proud, a dazzling dream 
With fire in my soul, and love in my eyes
A goddess of the Andes, I mesmerize
Sí, I'm a Colombian queen 
Beauty that must be seen

Verse 2:
My spirit soars like a condor on high
Graceful, determined, I aim for the sky
With coffee-colored skin and raven hair
Exotic elegance beyond compare  

(Chorus)
I am a Colombian queen
Radiant, proud, a dazzling dream
With fire in my soul, and love in my eyes  
A goddess of the Andes, I mesmerize
Sí, I'm a Colombian queen
Beauty that must be seen

Verse 3:
From Bogotá to Barranquilla's beat
Charm and allure from my head to my feet 
I sway my hips to a sensual groove
With a warm Latin heart and nothing to prove

(Chorus)
I am a Colombian queen 
Radiant, proud, a dazzling dream
With fire in my soul, and love in my eyes
A goddess of the Andes, I mesmerize  
Sí, I'm a Colombian queen
Breathtaking beauty, sight unseen
I am a Colombian queen!
