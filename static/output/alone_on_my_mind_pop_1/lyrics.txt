Alone in My Thoughts

Verse 1:
Silence surrounds me, a deafening sound
Echoes of your voice, still linger around
I try to escape, but there's nowhere to hide
'Cause you're always there, alone on my mind

Chorus:
I'm lost in the memory of your touch
Holding on to a love that was too much
Now I'm prisoner to my own thoughts
Everywhere I turn, I find you
Alone on my mind, always you
Alone on my mind, I'm so blue
