Title: "Burnout Blues"

Verse 1:
I've been grindin' day and night, no time to rest
Feels like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my chest
Responsibilities piling up, stress levels sky high
I need to hit the pause button, let out a sigh
Workin' overtime, tryna make ends meet
But this hustle's got me feeling dead on my feet
I'm running on empty, can't keep up this pace
I need a vacation, gotta find my own space

Chorus:
I am tired, need a break
Gotta step back, for my own sake
This burnout's real, can't keep going on
I need to recharge, before my energy's gone
I am tired, need a break
Gotta prioritize, before I make a mistake
Take a deep breath, let the stress dissolve
I'll come back stronger, after I resolve
