Title: "Countdown to Summer"

Verse 1:
Sitting in class, staring at the clock
Tick tock, tick tock, when will it stop?
Daydreaming 'bout those summer nights
Dancing under the neon lights
Can't focus on the words I write
'Cause my mind's already taking flight

Chorus:
Counting down the days until I'm free
No more books, just you and me
Sipping drinks by the pool, feeling cool
DJ's beats making bodies move
I can't wait for those summer parties
Making memories, getting crazy
Countdown to summer, let's go!
Countdown to summer, oh no!
