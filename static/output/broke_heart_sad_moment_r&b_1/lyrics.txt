Title: "Shattered Pieces"

Verse 1:
I thought we had it all, a love so strong and true
But now I'm left alone, wondering what to do
The promises we made, they vanished in the air
I'm picking up the pieces of my heart, scattered everywhere

Chorus:
Lost in this broke heart sad moment
Trying to find my way, but I don't know where I'm going
Tears falling like rain, as I'm holding on to the pain
In this broke heart sad moment, will I ever love again?

(Repeat Chorus)
