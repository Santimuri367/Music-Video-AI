Title: "The Winding Road"

Verse 1:
I've been walking down this winding road
For miles and miles, no end in sight
Through valleys deep and mountains high
I keep on moving, day and night

Chorus:
Oh, it's a long journey, but I won't give up
I'll keep on pushing, no matter what
Through rain and shine, I'll find my way
On this long journey, I'm here to stay

(Repeat Chorus)
