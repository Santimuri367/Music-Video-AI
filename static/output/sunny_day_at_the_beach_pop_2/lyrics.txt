Here is my attempt at pop style lyrics about a sunny day at the beach, with 2

"Seaside Sunshine"

Verse 1:
Sand beneath my feet, salty breeze in my hair 
Waves are crashing on the shore without a care
I've been waiting for this day, couldn't wait to get away
To splash in the surf and let my worries wash away

Chorus: 
It's a perfect sunny day, down at the beach
Gonna soak up those golden rays, as far as the eye can reach 
When life gets hard, this is my escape
On a sunny day, down at the beach 

Verse 2:
Seagulls soaring high, fluffy clouds in a clear blue sky
The sun is beaming down, not a frown to be found
Building castles in the sand, holding hands with my girl
On days like this I swear I'm on top of the world

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Oh I wish this day would never end
Making memories with my best friends
We'll stay until the sun goes down 
And stars fill the sky above the town

(Repeat Chorus)

Outtro: 
It's always a sunny day in my mind
Whenever I need to press rewind 
Take me back to the beach, every time
