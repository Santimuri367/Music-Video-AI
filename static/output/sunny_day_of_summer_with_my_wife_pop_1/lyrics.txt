Title: "Endless Summer Love"

Verse 1:
Driving down the coast, windows rolled down
Your hair dancing in the wind, not a single frown
Sun-kissed skin and that smile I adore
Every moment with you, I just want more

Chorus:
Oh, it's a perfect sunny day
Lost in love, just you and me
Making memories that will always stay
Our endless summer love, wild and free
Oh, it's a perfect sunny day
Forever by your side is where I'll be
Together we'll chase the sun's warm rays
Our endless summer love, just you and me
