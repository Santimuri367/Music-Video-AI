Title: "Empty Pages"

Verse 1:
Strollin' through the stacks, but the knowledge ain't free
Surrounded by books, but they don't speak to me
Pages full of words, but they're all just a blur
Inside this library, there's nothing to learn

The shelves are towering, reaching to the sky
But the wisdom they hold, it's all just a lie
I'm searching for answers, but I'm coming up dry
In this maze of books, I'm just wondering why

Chorus:
Inside the library, but nothing to learn
All these empty pages, they're making me yearn
For something real, something I can feel
But in this sea of books, nothing seems real

Inside the library, but nothing to learn
The silence is deafening, the truth is stern
I'm lost in the words, with nowhere to turn
Inside the library, but nothing to learn
