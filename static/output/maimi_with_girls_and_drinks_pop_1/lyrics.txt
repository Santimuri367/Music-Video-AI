"Miami Nights"

Verse 1:
The city's alive, the heat's on the rise
Cruisin' down Ocean Drive, got the top down, I'm feeling alive
Girls by my side, drinks in our hands
Living life in the fast lane, ain't got no plans

Chorus:
Miami nights, neon lights
Dancing till the sunrise, feeling so right
Miami nights, hold me tight
Girls and drinks, in the city where the party never dies
Miami nights, Miami nights
