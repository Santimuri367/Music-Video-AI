Here is an attempt at pop song lyrics about July with a friend on a boat:

Summer Vibes 

Verse 1:
Cruisin' on the water, July sun on our skin 
Smilin' with my bestie, leavin' all our cares on land
Sippin' ice cold lemonade, singin' along to our favorite tunes  
Nothin' else matters, just livin' life in full bloom

Chorus:
Oh these summer vibes 
Out on the waves, feelin' so alive 
Makin' memories to last all year
My best friend by my side 
Wishin' this July would never end
'Cause we got these summer vibes, summer vibes
