"Solitary Thoughts"

[Verse 1]
In the depths of my mind, I'm trapped all alone
Thoughts racing, pacing, can't find my way home
Shadows creeping, demons speaking, I'm in the unknown
Trying to break free, but I'm stuck in this zone
Feels like I'm drowning, no one around me
Screaming out loud, but there's no sound, see
I'm lost in this labyrinth, thoughts so profound
Can't escape this maze, I'm mentally bound

[Chorus]
Alone on my own mind, can't seem to unwind
Thoughts intertwined, I'm one of a kind
Isolated and confined, darkness has me blind
I'm alone on my own mind, leave my pain behind
Alone on my own mind, can't seem to unwind
Thoughts intertwined, I'm one of a kind
Isolated and confined, darkness has me blind
I'm alone on my own mind, gotta realign
