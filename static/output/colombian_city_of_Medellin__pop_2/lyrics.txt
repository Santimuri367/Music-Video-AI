"Medellín Magic"

Verse 1:
In the heart of Colombia, a city shines so bright
Medellín, a gem that sparkles day and night
From the hills of Poblado to the streets of El Centro
There's a rhythm in the air, a beat that never slows

Chorus:
Medellín, oh Medellín
Your magic never ends
From the mountains to the valleys
You're a city of true friends
Medellín, oh Medellín 
In my heart, you'll always stay
With your warmth and your passion
You take my breath away

Verse 2:
Stroll through Parque Lleras, where the nightlife comes alive
Salsa, reggaeton, and bachata, the music's always live
Ride the cable cars up high, see the city from above
Medellín's a masterpiece, painted with peace and love

(Repeat Chorus)
